# WebAppHoriseon2.1

## Description

A responsive and interactive web app template using HTML and CSS. The project is organized towards the realization of each requirement, ensuring easy management, clarity and smooth deployment. This template is a refactor for the existing site of Horiseon to make it more accessible and semantical.

### Refactoring requirements completed
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements are concise and descriptive
* CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow a semantic structure

To observe the new usability of this web app, you can review the updates made by opening the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There, you will see the updated Web app of Horiseon aimed towards semantics and accessibility of the HTML and CSS codes.
